# PS4 Skeleton

## Synopsis

A "base" package for those interested in creating homebrew with the [Open Orbis Toolchain]. It include functions that set up easy logging (via [libLog]), notifications (via [notifi]), jailbreaking capabilities (via sleirsgoevy's [libJbc]).

## Notes

- Be sure to change the PKG metadata in `Makefile` to something other than the default as to not conflict with other PKGs built upon this as a base.
